# Documentation Website for openairinterface5g (Zensical)

The Duranta openairinterface5g documentation is written in Markdown
and maintained throughout the repository, from `doc/` to README files
alongside the source code in directories such as `radio/`, `common/`, and `openair1/`.

This directory brings the documentation together into a single, searchable website
using [Zensical](https://zensical.org/), the successor of
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), customized
with the Duranta branding. The site is configured in `zensical.toml` at the
repository root.

The original Markdown files remain unchanged, preserving their readability and
rendering on GitHub while making the documentation accessible through a unified website.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.10 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a Git clone of the repository: the build
  uses Git to find the documentation files

## Virtual environment (optional)

To keep the documentation tools separate from your system Python, create and
activate a virtual environment from the repository root before the Quick start:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

All Quick start commands then run inside it. When finished, leave it with
`deactivate`.

The `.venv/` directory is local to your environment and must not be committed
to Git. The site build skips hidden directories, so it is not published either.

## Quick start

From the repository root, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r doc/website/requirements.txt
```

Start the development server to preview the documentation locally.
The site rebuilds automatically when files change.

```bash
python3 doc/website/run.py serve
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view the site.

To use a different port for the preview, replace `<PORT_NUMBER>` with your preferred port (e.g., `8005`):

```bash
python3 doc/website/run.py serve -a 127.0.0.1:<PORT_NUMBER>
```

To build the static site for deployment, run:

```bash
python3 doc/website/run.py build
```

The generated site is written to `build/website/`.
To serve the generated static files locally, run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory build/website
```

For more details, run `python3 doc/website/run.py --help`.

## Validation

Before submitting a pull request, run a strict build to check for warnings and
errors:

```bash
python3 doc/website/run.py build --strict
```

The strict build fails if the build reports any warning, such as a link to a
missing file or to a missing section (`page.md#section`). This catches broken
documentation before it is merged.

Unlike `serve`, which only prints warnings and keeps serving the site,
`build --strict` stops with an error code, so it can also be used in CI.

> [!NOTE]
> `run.py` stores generated files under `build/`, which is ignored by Git.
> The `build/docs-src/` directory contains processed copies of the documentation.
> Edit the original files in the repository, as these copies are regenerated on each build.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use** (`Address already in use`): another server is
  running on that port; pick another one with
  `python3 doc/website/run.py serve -a 127.0.0.1:8005`.
- **Missing dependencies** (`ModuleNotFoundError`, e.g. `No module named
  `'zensical'`): activate the virtual environment, or install them
  with `pip install -r doc/website/requirements.txt` (see
  [Quick start](#quick-start)).
- **Build errors**: check the terminal output for invalid configuration in
  `zensical.toml`, missing files, or errors in `run.py` and the `docs_site/`
  modules.
- **`Could not fetch GitHub label colors`**: harmless. It happens offline or
  when the GitHub API rate limit is reached. The label pills (e.g. in
  `doc/TESTBenches.md`) then use the last colors cached in
  `build/website-cache/`, or a default color. To raise the rate limit, run with
  a token: `GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> python3 doc/website/run.py serve`.
